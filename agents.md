- **Scope**: Full repository access for code changes
- **Technologies**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Usage**: Automatically triggered for development tasks and code reviews

### Documentation Agent
- **Purpose**: Maintains and updates project documentation
- **Scope**: Markdown files and documentation
- **Usage**: Creates and updates documentation files like this one

## Repository Automation

### Continuous Integration
- **Status**: Not currently configured
- **Future Plans**: Consider adding GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

### Dependency Management
- **Status**: Manual management
- **Dependencies**: External CDN links for Font Awesome and Google Fonts
- **Recommendations**: Consider dependency automation for production deployments

## AI-Assisted Development Practices
